# Rewards Program System

This is a rewards program system designed for retailers to offer a rewards program to their customers. It allows retailers to award points to customers based on each recorded purchase. The system consists of a JSON server as the backend and React as the frontend.

## Features

-   Points are awarded based on the recorded purchase amount.
-   The system provides a user-friendly interface for retailers and customers.
-   The system utilizes a JSON server as the backend to store and retrieve data.
-   The frontend is built using React, providing a responsive and interactive user experience.

## Getting Started

To run the system locally, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd rewards-program-system`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

### Starting the System

To start the frontend and backend concurrently, use the following command:
